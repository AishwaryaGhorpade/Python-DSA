What is Encapsulation in Python?

Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class)
and restricting direct access to some components.

In simple words:

Encapsulation protects data from being modified directly.

Python uses:

Public members

Protected members

Private members

These access levels help control how data is accessed or modified.

🔹 Why Encapsulation is Important?

Prevents accidental data modification

Increases security

Allows controlled access to data

Helps maintain clean, modular code

Supports data hiding

🔹 Encapsulation Levels in Python
✔ 1. Public members

Accessible from anywhere.

✔ 2. Protected members (_variable)

Meant for internal use inside the class and subclasses.

✔ 3. Private members (__variable)

Name-mangled; cannot be accessed directly outside the class.

Let's break them down with examples:
🔹 1. Public Members
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name       # public
        self.age = age         # public

s = Student("Aishwarya", 22)
print(s.name)  # Allowed
print(s.age)   # Allowed


Public data is accessible everywhere.

🔹 2. Protected Members (_variable)

A protected member starts with a single underscore _.

Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self._marks = 85   # protected variable

s = Student()
print(s._marks)  o/p->85  # Technically allowed but not recommended


Python does not enforce protection strictly,
but by convention:

_marks should not be accessed directly from outside.

🔹 3. Private Members (__variable)

Private members start with double underscore __.

These get name-mangled internally to:

_className__variableName


This prevents accidental access.

Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__password = "abcd123"   # private variable

s = Student()
print(s.__password)     # ❌ ERROR.   #cann't access __Password from outside class


Output:

AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute '__password'


So private variables are hidden.

🔹 How to access private variables? (Getter/Setter methods)

To access private data safely, we use methods.

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__password = "abcd123"

    def get_password(self):  # getter
        return self.__password

    def set_password(self, new_pass):  # setter
        if len(new_pass) >= 4:
            self.__password = new_pass
        else:
            print("Password too short!")

s = Student()
print(s.get_password())   # Access through getter
s.set_password("xyz")     # Controlled update

✔ Controlled access
✔ Data protection
✔ Validation possible
🔹 Encapsulation Example (Real-Life)
ATM PIN

You cannot access or change PIN directly.
You must use:

insert card

enter PIN

press buttons

The internal logic is hidden.

Same in Python:

Private variables = PIN
Public methods = ATM buttons

🔹 Advanced Example: Bank Account Encapsulation
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # private

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Invalid or insufficient funds")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

Usage:
acc = BankAccount(5000)
acc.deposit(2000)
acc.withdraw(1000)
print(acc.get_balance())


You can use the balance but cannot directly modify it:

acc.__balance = 0   # ❌ Does NOT change actual balance


This protects the data.

🔹 Encapsulation vs Abstraction — Difference
| Encapsulation                               | Abstraction                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Hides **data**                              | Hides **implementation**                    |
| Achieved with **private/protected members** | Achieved using **abstract classes/methods** |
| Focuses on **how data is accessed**         | Focuses on **what methods must do**         |
| More about **data protection**              | More about **design/architecture**          |


🔹 Interview Points (Very Important)

Encapsulation = data hiding + controlled access

Private variables use name mangling

Use getters/setters to access/modify private data

Python uses underscores to indicate access levels

Encapsulation improves security and prevents misuse

⭐ Final Summary in Simple Words

Encapsulation wraps data and methods into one unit and protects the data by restricting direct access using private and protected members. You control how data is accessed using getter/setter methods.
