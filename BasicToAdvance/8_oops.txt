Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python — Detailed Explanation

Python supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
OOP focuses on creating objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

The four main pillars of OOP are:

1.Encapsulation

2.Abstraction

3.Inheritance

4.Polymorphism

Before these, let’s cover the basics.

🔹 Class and Object
Class

A class is a blueprint or template.

class Car:
    color = "Red"

    def start(self):
        print("Car Started")

Object

An object is an instance of a class.

c1 = Car()
print(c1.color)
c1.start()

🧩 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation means wrapping data and behavior into a single unit (class) + controlling access to data.

Python uses:

public attributes → name

protected attributes → _name

private attributes → __name

Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.__name = name      # private
        self._marks = marks     # protected

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

s = Student("Aishwarya", 85)
print(s.get_name())      # Access through method


Private variables cannot be accessed directly → ensures data protection.

🧩 2. Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding complex implementation and showing only the required things.

Python has abstract classes using the abc module.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass   # only declaration → no implementation

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"


Why abstraction?

User sees what the method does, not how it works.

Encourages clean, maintainable code.

Even normal methods hide logic, but abstract methods force child classes to implement the method — that’s the difference.

🧩 3. Inheritance

Inheritance means one class acquiring the properties and methods of another class.

Python supports:

Single

Multilevel

Multiple inheritance

Hierarchical

Example:
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent Method")

class Child(Parent):
    pass

c = Child()
c.show()


Child inherits show() from Parent.

🧩 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism = one name, many forms.

Types:

Method overriding (same method, different implementation in child)

Method overloading (Python does not support directly, but we simulate using default parameters)

Method overriding Example:
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird can fly")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin cannot fly")

b = Bird()
p = Penguin()
b.fly()
p.fly()

🔥 Example of All OOP Concepts Together
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):                 # Abstraction
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self._brand = brand         # Encapsulation

    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):                 # Inheritance
    def start(self):
        return f"{self._brand} Car Started"  # Polymorphism (override)

c1 = Car("Tesla")
print(c1.start())

🎯 Why OOP is Important in Python?

✔ Organized code
✔ Reusable (inheritance)
✔ Easy maintenance
✔ Scalable
✔ Protects data
